## Project overview

The aim of the project is to classifiy the images into either humans or dogs. If the provided image is a dog, it model should classify it as a dog and provide the relavent breed. If the image is of a human, the model should provide the relavent breed of a dog. If the image passed is neither a dog nor a human face, the model should say the same.

## File Descriptions
dog_app_final- the python notebook illustrated the flow of developing the model and testing it as instructed by the udacity

## Results:
路 The final model was able to detect human faces and provide the relevant dog breed.
路 It was also able to identify dog faces and proved the probable dog breed they belong to.
路 However, the classification among dog breeds was only 60% accurate imposing further improvements.
路 Model successfully distinguished the images that are neither dogs nor humans.
